# EV-vs.-Non-EV-Vehicle-Registration-in-Washington-State
Project Overview
This project examines vehicle registration trends in Washington State, with a particular focus on Electric Vehicles (EVs) compared to non-EVs from 2017 to 2024. The analysis provides insights into EV adoption, county-wise distributions, and the performance of different EV types, such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to visualize the data, enabling users to explore key trends and patterns that inform sustainable transportation strategies.

Objectives
1.	Analyze yearly trends in EV and Non-EV registrations.
2.	Identify top counties for EV adoption and their performance.
3.	Compare BEVs and PHEVs in terms of registration patterns.
4.	Explore passenger vs. truck ratios among EVs.
5.	Provide actionable insights to support EV adoption and policy development. Dataset
Dataset
    Source: Kaggle Dataset on Electric Vehicle Population Size in Washington State.

Key Columns:
        Date, State, County, Vehicle Primary Use
        Battery_Electric_Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-In_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles (PHEVs)
        Electric_Vehicle_(EV)Total, Non-Electric_Vehicle_Total

Key Insights
1.	Steady Growth: EV registrations reached 63,000 by 2024, representing 0.35% of total vehicle registrations.
2.	Top Counties: Benton, Island, and Skagit lead in EV adoption, reflecting strong growth patterns.
3.	PHEVs vs. BEVs: Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles slightly outperform Battery Electric Vehicles across multiple counties.
4.	Usage Trends: Passenger vehicles dominate EV usage at 56%, with trucks accounting for the remaining 44%.

Dashboard Features
The dashboard visualizes:
1.	Year-wise Trends: Line charts compare EV and Non-EV registrations from 2017 to 2024.
2.	County-wise Analysis: Bar charts highlight the top counties for EV adoption.
3.	PHEV vs. BEV Comparison: A breakdown of registration numbers for both EV types.
4.	Usage Ratios: Pie charts show the distribution between passenger EVs and trucks.
5.	The dashboard enables interactive filtering by year, county, and vehicle type, making it easy to explore patterns and trends.
